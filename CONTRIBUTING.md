## File encoding and line endings

This project uses **LF (Unix-style) line endings** and **UTF-8 encoding** for all text files (source, config, scripts, documentation). A `.gitattributes` file in this directory enforces consistent behavior across IDEs and platforms. When contributing, ensure your editor is configured for UTF-8 and LF.
